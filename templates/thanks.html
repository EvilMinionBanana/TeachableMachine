                              their user-friendly experience and for the machine that drives this project/website. Thank you

                              We (I) would like to thank Paul Way for his help when I would get stuck.
                              Without his guidance, there would be no sound that plays, no website, and this would just be a screen
                              that says URL Not Found Error 401291203... Thank you!
                      </p>

                <p>
                              We (I) would like to thank the websites such as W3 Schools, Youtube, and the internet
                              for all the resources used in this project that include but are not limited to: images, background
                              audio sound, coding help, and syntax. Thank you!

                <p>
                  Finally, we (I) would like to thank YOU! Without your utilization of this website, it would be nothing.
                  Just kidding, it would still be here but you make it better. Thank you everyone!
